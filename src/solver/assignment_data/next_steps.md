- generate representation which bins types by allocation.
- integrate efficiency into visualization.
  - consider trading probabilities as general case.
  - its possible that opening probabilities market makes things worse off, so be careful
  - connections with game theory
  - put social welfare in representation
    - consider ex-post inefficiency
    - consider interim inefficiency (probability trading)
    - capacity of schools
  - find social welfare value generated without IC constraint
    - would people want to trade? if preferences are not known, yes. otherwise, no. In our case, no
    - this would tell us how much better off we would be if preferences were known
  - Do we ever not fill school seats
    - sometimes, someone doesn't go to school
    
- next: open market where everyone gets a dollar and bids
  - quadratic program to give optimal prices
  - must be worse than linear, as it is subset of all mechanisms 
  - see how much worse 
- raffle mechanism: 
  - some overlap, exact conditions for equivalence
    - concentration inequalities, bounding events
  - can we give conditions such that efficiency loss is small
  - different ordinal and cardinal preferences
- Boston Mechanism:
  - every round, parent submits to one school. School ranks by academic criteria and distance/siblings.
    - schools admit until capacity is full
    - low-education parents didn't understand mechanism, and so IC was violated (rationalizability)
    - risk aversion bias; look at mechanisms which don't care about risk aversion
      - deferred acceptance: student proposes to favorites, schools pick favorites, students propose to next best, ...
      - outcome is stable
  - if you didn't get seat, begin at next round
- could we just take rankings
  - can we make it so that people tell the truth even without knowing cardinality
    - deferred acceptance
  - random tyrants: same as deferred acceptance (if schools don't have preferences)
    - preferences of schools may not be as well-understood
    

Think of further models
  - time as incentive mechanism
  - extend auctions to game theory applications
  - analyze boston mechanism: what is Nash Eq.
    - what are eq. for other
  - use Nash eq. as constraint

 
 Try 100 types in 10 minutes. Try 60 minutes.
